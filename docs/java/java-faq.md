# Frequent Asked Questions

Thanks for your interest in Java on Visual Studio Code! This FAQ will hopefully answer some of the questions you may have.

## Q: Are these Java extensions open source?

Absolutely. All the [Java Extensions](/docs/java/extensions.md) provided by Red Hat, Microsoft and Pivotal are open source, as well as most ones supported by community. You can find their corresponding repositories on GitHub from the marketplace pages.

## Q: Are there any other feature coming to Java on Visual Studio Code?

Definitely. We use GitHub Issues to track most of our incoming requests and planned work for each of our extensions. Currently we're working on bringing more refactoring features and linting to enhance the editing productivity, as well as some performance improvements to make it even faster.

Most of our work are collected from and prioritized by customer feedbacks. If you're interested in providing your thoughts, you can either go directly to our project repositories to submit new issue or use this [Survey Link](https://www.research.net/r/vscodejava) to share your thoughts.

At the same time, we do have limited capacity within the team and we'd really like to encourage more contribution from the great Java community. If you're passionate about your idea and would like to help our fellow Java developers, welcome to join us! Some areas worth considering including Gradle support, code analysis and test coverage tools, profiler, additional framework support including DropWizard, JavaFX, JPA, Play, Akka, OSGi.

## Q: Where can I find the latest progress of Java support on Visual Studio Code?

We're currently publishing our updates at [The Visual Studio Blog](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/tag/java/), which will report all our major features and improvements.

While you're using Java within VS Code, you might also see a *Release Notes* once you update the [Java Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack). That will give you an overview on the notable updates included in the extensions.

## Q: Will this be available for Visual Studio?

Currently we don't plan to extend the Java support to Visual Studio. There's already great IDEs for Java and we're focusing on VS Code to provide a lightweight experience in a polyglot editor.

## Q: Does VS Code Java support other display languages?

Currently we support Chinese language in addition to English with a few extensions including [Debugger for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-debug), [Java Test Runner](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-test), [Maven for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-maven), [Java Dependency Viewer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-dependency). You can switch display language follow [Display Languages](/docs/getstarted/locales.md).

You can contribute to the repositories of the extensions if you're interested in contributing additional display language support.
