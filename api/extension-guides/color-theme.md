# Color Theme

This should be one of the options mentioned in https://vscode-ext-docs.azurewebsites.net/api/extension-capabilities/theming.

- Migrate content from https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/extensions/themes-snippets-colorizers#_adding-a-new-color-theme
- Update https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-extension-samples/tree/master/theme-sample so it includes a README and link back to this guide
