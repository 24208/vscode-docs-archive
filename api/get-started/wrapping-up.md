# Wrapping Up

In the [Your First Extension](/api/get-started/your-first-extension) topic, you learned how to create, run and debug an extension. In the [Extension Anatomy](/api/get-started/extension-anatomy) topic, you learned fundamental concepts to Visual Studio Code extension development. However, we only touched the tip of the iceberg, and here are some suggested routes for furthering your VS Code extension development skills.

## Working with extensions

This section includes topics that help you develop high-quality VS Code extension. For example, you can learn

- How to add [integration tests](/api/working-with-extensions/testing-extensions) for your extension
- How to publish your extension to [VS Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/)
- How to set up [Continuous Integration](/api/working-with-extensions/continous-integration) (CI) for your extension

## Extension Capabilities

In this section, we split the [VS Code API](/api/references/vscode-api) and [Contribution Points](/api/references/contribution-points) into a few categories, each with short descriptions as to what your extension could achieve.

## Samples & Guides

We have a great collection of sample extensions that you can adapt from, and some of them include a detailed guide that explains the source code. You can find all Samples & Guides in the [Extension Guide Listing](/api/extension-guides/overview) or the [vscode-extension-samples](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-extension-samples) repository.
