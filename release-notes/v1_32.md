## Insiders Release

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the February 1.32 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the February release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[February Iteration Plan](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/68293)** - See what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit Log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/86?closed=1)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the February milestone.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the VS Code repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues).

## Editor

### Auto fix and preferred code actions

The Code Action API powers VS Code's Quick Fixes (the lightbulbs you see in the editor). Although there may be many Quick Fixes for a given error, often one of these Quick Fixes is the most reasonable fix for the problem. For example, fixing a spelling error is usually the more likely fix than generating new fields:

![The fix spelling Quick Fix is usually more reasonable than generating properties](images/1_31/api-preferred.png)

Extensions can now mark a code action as "preferred" to indicate that is the most reasonable fix for the underlying problem. Preferred fixes can be automatically applied using the **Auto Fix** command (`kb(editor.action.autoFix)`)

![After applying an auto fix to the error](TODO)

Preferred Quick Fixes should generally:

* Correctly fix the underlying error (and not suppress it).
* Be a reasonable fix for the error.
* Not perform extensive operations unexpectedly.

Refactoring Code Actions can also be marked as preferred to indicate that they are the most reasonable refactoring. For example, while multiple **Extract constant** refactorings may be available, often the user just wants to extract to the nearest local. If that refactoring Code Action is marked `isPreferred`, users can set up a single keybinding for it:

```json
{
  "key": "ctrl+shift+r ctrl+e",
  "command": "editor.action.codeAction",
  "args": {
    "kind": "refactor.extract.constant",
    "preferred": true
  }
}
```

### Fix All Source Actions

The new `source.fixAll` `CodeActionKind` establishes a convention for extensions that can auto fix errors in a file. This new Source Action kind is similar to **Organize imports** and makes it easy to configure keybindings for fix all actions or enable autofix on save:

```json
// On save, run both fixAll and organizeImports source actions
"editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    "source.fixAll": true,
    "source.organizeImports": true,
}
```

The [TSLint extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-tslint-plugin) already uses `source.fixAll` Code Action kind to implement fix all and auto fix on save.

### SignatureHelpContext.activeSignatureHelp

`SignatureHelpContext` object now have an `activeSignatureHelp` field that tracks the previously active signature:

```typescript
import * as vscode from 'vscode';

class MySignatureHelpProvider implements vscode.SignatureHelpProvider {
    provideSignatureHelp(
        document: vscode.TextDocument,
        position: vscode.Position,
        token: vscode.CancellationToken,
        context: vscode.SignatureHelpContext
    ): vscode.ProviderResult<vscode.SignatureHelp> {
        // The active signature help when this provider was triggered or undefined if
        // no signature help was active.
        console.log(context.activeSignatureHelp);

        ...
    }
}
```

Providers can use this to track which overload was selected before the signature help provider was retriggered.

## Engineering

### Strict null progress
We continued to make good progress towards [strict null checking the main VS Code codebase](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/60565). This iteration, we cut the number of remaining strict null errors in half, fixing over 2000 errors. We still have around 1800 strict null errors left—and many of the remaining errors are tricky ones—but the finishline is in sight.
