## Insiders Release

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the February 1.32 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the February release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[February Iteration Plan](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/68293)** - See what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit Log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/86?closed=1)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the February milestone.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the VS Code repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues).

## Workbench

### Themes: Install, Preview and Apply

You can now preview and apply the theme immediately after installing it.

### Keyboard Shortcuts Editor

You can now edit `when` expression of a keybinding from the Keyboard Shortcuts Editor.

![Changing When Expression](images/1_32/keyboard-shortcuts-when.gif)

Removed the link that opens the `keybindings.json` file from the Keyboard Shortcuts Editor in favour of the button `{}` in the editor title area which does the same. Also changed the behaviour to open `keybindings.json` file alone by default. You can change it to open `Default Keybindings` along with `keybindings.json` by setting `workbench.settings.openDefaultKeybindings` to `true`.

## Editor

### Hover and Problem peek view improvements

In this release, we added some love to hover and problem peek view to make them look better.

- Hovers with problems and code blocks are given enough space to show their contents

![Hover](images/1_32/hover.png)

- A status bar with `Quick Fix...` and `Peek Problem` actions is added to the problems hover. `Quick Fix...` action will allow you applying quick fixes from the hover and `Peek Problem` action will open the problem peek view in the editor, thereby making it eay to discover.

- Problem peek view is now navigatable by mouse and is made consistent with other peek views.

### Auto fix and preferred Code Actions

The Code Action API powers VS Code's Quick Fixes (the lightbulbs you see in the editor). Although there may be many Quick Fixes for a given error, often one of these Quick Fixes is the most reasonable fix for the problem. For example, fixing a spelling error is usually the more likely fix than generating new fields:

![The fix spelling Quick Fix is more reasonable than generating properties](images/1_31/api-preferred.png)

Extensions can now mark a Code Action as "preferred" to indicate that it is the most reasonable fix for the underlying problem. Preferred fixes can be automatically applied using the **Auto Fix** command (`kb(editor.action.autoFix)`)

![After applying an auto fix to the error](TODO)

Preferred Quick Fixes should generally:

* Correctly fix the underlying error (and not suppress it).
* Be a reasonable fix for the error.
* Not perform extensive operations unexpectedly.

Refactoring Code Actions can also be marked as preferred to indicate that they are the most reasonable refactoring. For example, while multiple **Extract constant** refactorings may be available, the user usually wants to extract to the nearest local. If that refactoring Code Action is marked `isPreferred`, users can set up a single keybinding for it:

```json
{
  "key": "ctrl+shift+r ctrl+e",
  "command": "editor.action.codeAction",
  "args": {
    "kind": "refactor.extract.constant",
    "preferred": true
  }
}
```

### Fix All Source Actions

The new `source.fixAll` `CodeActionKind` establishes a convention for extensions that can auto fix errors in a file. This new Source Action kind is similar to **Organize imports** and makes it easy to configure keybindings for fix all actions or enable autofix on save:

```json
// On save, run both fixAll and organizeImports source actions
"editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    "source.fixAll": true,
    "source.organizeImports": true,
}
```

The [TSLint extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-tslint-plugin) already uses `source.fixAll` Code Action kind to implement fix all and auto fix on save.

## Languages

### TypeScript 3.3.3333

### Dynamic TypeScript extensions

## Extension Authoring

### SignatureHelpContext.activeSignatureHelp

`SignatureHelpContext` object now have an `activeSignatureHelp` field that tracks the previously active signature:

```typescript
import * as vscode from 'vscode';

class MySignatureHelpProvider implements vscode.SignatureHelpProvider {
    provideSignatureHelp(
        document: vscode.TextDocument,
        position: vscode.Position,
        token: vscode.CancellationToken,
        context: vscode.SignatureHelpContext
    ): vscode.ProviderResult<vscode.SignatureHelp> {
        // The active signature help when this provider was triggered or undefined if
        // no signature help was active.
        console.log(context.activeSignatureHelp);

        ...
    }
}
```

Providers can use this to track which overload was selected before the signature help provider was retriggered.

## Engineering

### Linux 32-bit support ends soon

VS Code is using [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) as framework to run on multiple platforms. We are currently using Electron version 3.x, which will be the last version to support Linux on 32-bit architectures. As we are planning to move to Electron 4.x soon (1-2 months), this means that VS Code will no longer run on Linux 32-bit. Please [update](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) your version of VS Code to the 64-bit version. All your settings and extensions will work as before without the need to migrate anything.

### Strict null progress

We continued to make good progress towards [strict null checking the main VS Code codebase](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/60565). This iteration, we cut the number of remaining strict null errors in half, fixing over 2000 errors. We still have around 1800 strict null errors left, and many of the remaining errors are tricky ones, but the end is in sight.

### Compiling to ES6

VS Code is written TypeScript, and TypeScript is compiled into JavaScript. TypeScript can target different JavaScript versions and with this release, we target ES6 JavaScript. ES6 is much closer to TypeScript and produces less code, which means faster loading times.

**Note:** This means our JavaScript output uses [classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes) as defined in JavaScript. We have a utility in place that still allows functions to "extend" from those classes and we have created a [tracking item](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/68698) for extensions authors to now emit ES6 as well. Everything should still work as before but we encourage everyone to get on the ES6 train.

### New tree widget for outline and breadcrumbs

The document symbol view and breadcrumb picker have adopted the new tree widget. That makes them faster, gives them better filtering support and all the other new tree goddies.
