## Insiders Release

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the February 1.32 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the February release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[February Iteration Plan](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/68293)** - See what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit Log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/86?closed=1)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the February milestone.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the VS Code repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues).

## Workbench

### Default title bar style on Linux

After listening to user feedback, we have made the decision to revert our change of the default setting `window.titleBarStyle` from `custom` back to `native`. We still recommend the custom title bar for those needing better accessibility support. More information on this change has been documented in our [Linux setup](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2074137) page.

### Preview and apply new themes

You can now preview and apply color and file icon themes immediately after installing an extension that contributes them.

![Applying Theme](images/1_32/theme-install.gif)

### New tree widget for Outline view and breadcrumbs

The Outline document symbol view and breadcrumb picker have adopted the new tree widget. The new implementation makes them faster and gives better filtering support, along with other new tree widget enhancements.

### Keyboard Shortcuts Editor

You can now edit the `when` clause of a keybinding in the Keyboard Shortcuts Editor.

![Changing When Expression](images/1_32/keyboard-shortcuts-when.gif)

We removed the link that opens your `keybindings.json` file from the Keyboard Shortcuts Editor in favor of the **{}** button on the right of the editor title bar.

When directly editing your `keybindings.json` file, the default keybindings are no longer shown on the left. If you prefer to see **Default Keybindings**, you can check the **Workbench > Settings: Open Default Keybindings** setting (`workbench.settings.openDefaultKeybindings` to `true`).


## Editor

### Hover and Problems panel peek improvements

In this release, we improved the appearance of the hovers and the Problem panel peek view.

Hovers with problems and code blocks are given enough space to show their contents:

![Hover](images/1_32/hover.png)

A command bar with **Quick Fix** and **Peek Problem** actions was added to the Problems panel hover. The **Quick Fix** action applies Quick Fixes from the hover and the **Peek Problem** action will open the peek view in the editor.

![Problem Hover](images/1_32/problem-hover.png)

From the Problems panel peek view you can now navigate to the previous and next error/warnings.

![Problem Peek](images/1_32/problem-peek.png)

### Auto fix and preferred Code Actions

The Code Action API powers VS Code's Quick Fixes (the lightbulbs you see in the editor). Although there may be many Quick Fixes for a given error, often one of these Quick Fixes is the most reasonable fix for the problem. For example, fixing a spelling error is usually the more likely fix than generating new fields:

![The fix spelling Quick Fix is more reasonable than generating properties](TODO)

Extensions can now mark a Code Action as "preferred" to indicate that it is the most reasonable fix for the underlying problem. Preferred fixes can be automatically applied using the **Auto Fix** command (`kb(editor.action.autoFix)`)

![After applying an auto fix to the error](TODO)

Preferred Quick Fixes should generally:

* Correctly fix the underlying error (and not suppress it).
* Be a reasonable fix for the error.
* Not perform extensive operations unexpectedly.

Refactoring Code Actions can also be marked as preferred to indicate that they are the most reasonable refactoring. For example, while multiple **Extract constant** refactorings may be available, the user usually wants to extract to the nearest local. If that refactoring Code Action is marked `isPreferred`, users can set up a single keybinding for it:

```json
{
  "key": "ctrl+shift+r ctrl+e",
  "command": "editor.action.codeAction",
  "args": {
    "kind": "refactor.extract.constant",
    "preferred": true
  }
}
```

### Fix All Source Actions

The new `source.fixAll` `CodeActionKind` establishes a convention for extensions that can auto fix errors in a file. This new Source Action kind is similar to **Organize imports** and makes it easy to configure keybindings for fix all actions or enable autofix on save:

```json
// On save, run both fixAll and organizeImports source actions
"editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    "source.fixAll": true,
    "source.organizeImports": true,
}
```

The [TSLint extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-tslint-plugin) already uses `source.fixAll` Code Action kind to implement fix all and auto fix on save.

## Languages

### TypeScript 3.3.3

This release includes TypeScript 3.3.43, a small update that [fixes a few important bugs](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/milestone/90?closed=1).

### No reload required when installing TypeScript extensions

[Last iteration](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_31#_no-reload-on-install), VS Code was changed to no longer require a reload after installing the vast majority of extensions. VS Code now also supports dynamic loading of [TypeScript plugin extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/contribution-points#contributes.typescriptServerPlugins) as well. When you install a new TypeScript extension, such as [TSLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-tslint-plugin), the extension is automatically enabled without requiring a reload.

### No reload required when installing Markdown extensions

In addition, you longer need to reload VS Code after installing an extension such as [GitHub Markdown Preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.github-markdown-preview). Any active Markdown previews will be automatically updated as soon as a Markdown extension is installed.

### Improved HTML IntelliSense for ARIA attribute and events

Thanks to data retrieved from [W3C](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#state_prop_def) and [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Events), VS Code now shows descriptions for ARIA attributes and HTML events attributes.

![HTML IntelliSense for ARIA and Event attributes](./images/1_32/html-attribute-completion.gif)

### Removed Razor support in HTML extension

The legacy ASP.NET Razor support has been removed. We now recommend the [C# extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.csharp) for editing Razor files.

## Debugging

### Font configuration for Debug Console

TODO@isidorn

## Integrated Terminal

### Variable support in send sequence command

It's now possible to use [variables](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/variables-reference) with the `workbench.action.terminal.sendSequence` command, for example:

```json
{
  "key": "ctrl+shift+t",
  "command": "workbench.action.terminal.sendSequence",
  "args": { "text": ". ${file}" }
}
```

## Preview features

Preview features are not ready for release but are functional enough to use. We welcome your early feedback while they are under development.

### Automatically open a URI when debugging a server program

Developing a web program typically requires opening a specific URL in a web browser in order to hit the server code in the debugger. In this milestone, we added a first cut of a new VS Code feature that tries to automate this process in a flexible way.

Here is an example of a simple [Node.js Express](https://expressjs.com) application:

```javascript
var express = require('express');
var app = express();

app.get('/', function (req, res) {
  res.send('Hello World!')
});

app.listen(3000, function () {
  console.log('Example app listening on port 3000!')
});
```

This application first installs a "Hello World" handler for the "/" URL and then starts to listen for HTTP connections on port 3000. The port is announced in the Debug Console and typically the developer would now type `http://localhost:3000` into their browser application.

The new feature makes it possible to add a structured property `serverReadyAction` to any launch config and select an "action" to be performed:

```json
{
  "type": "node",
  "request": "launch",
  "name": "Launch Program",
  "program": "${workspaceFolder}/app.js",

  "serverReadyAction": {
    "pattern": "listening on port ([0-9]+)",
    "uriFormat": "http://localhost:%s",
    "action": "openExternally"
  }
}
```

Here the `pattern` property describes the regular expression for matching the program's output string that announces the port. The pattern for the port number is put into parenthesis so that it is available as a regular expression capture group. In this example, we are extracting only the port number, but it is also possible to extract a full URI.

The `uriFormat` property describes how the port number is turned into a URI. The first `%s` is substituted by the first capture group of the matching pattern.

The resulting URI is then opened outside of VS Code ("externally") with the standard application configured for the URI's scheme.

Alternatively, the `action` can be set to `debugWithChrome`. In this case, VS Code starts a Chrome debug session for the URI (which requires that the [Debugger for Chrome](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome) extension is installed). In this mode, a `webRoot` property can be added that is passed to the Chrome debug session.

To simplify things a bit, most properties are optional and we use the following fallback values:

* **pattern**: `"listening on.* (https?://\\S+|[0-9]+)"` which matches the commonly used messages "listening on port 3000" or "Now listening on: https://localhost:5001".
* **uriFormat**: `"http://localhost:%s"`
* **webRoot**: `"${workspaceFolder}"`

And here the feature in action:

![Server ready feature in action](./images/1_32/server-ready.gif)

Please note that in the preview release of the feature:

* The pattern is only matched in the Debug Console. It doesn't yet work if the debug target is launched in the Integrated Terminal (and it will never work in external terminals).
* The feature does not warn if `debugWithChrome` is configured but the **Debugger for Chrome** extension is not installed.
* It is not yet possible to use other browser-based debuggers.

## Extension Authoring

### SignatureHelpContext.activeSignatureHelp

`SignatureHelpContext` object now have an `activeSignatureHelp` field that tracks the previously active signature:

```typescript
import * as vscode from 'vscode';

class MySignatureHelpProvider implements vscode.SignatureHelpProvider {
    provideSignatureHelp(
        document: vscode.TextDocument,
        position: vscode.Position,
        token: vscode.CancellationToken,
        context: vscode.SignatureHelpContext
    ): vscode.ProviderResult<vscode.SignatureHelp> {
        // The active signature help when this provider was triggered or undefined if
        // no signature help was active.
        console.log(context.activeSignatureHelp);

        ...
    }
}
```

Providers can use this to track which overload was selected before the signature help provider was retriggered.

## Engineering

### Linux 32-bit support ends soon

VS Code is using [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) as framework to run on multiple platforms. We are currently using Electron version 3.x, which will be the last version to support Linux on 32-bit architectures. As we are planning to move to Electron 4.x soon (1-2 months), this means that VS Code will no longer run on Linux 32-bit. Please [update](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) your version of VS Code to the 64-bit version. All your settings and extensions will work as before without the need to migrate anything.

### Strict null progress

We continued to make good progress towards [strict null checking the main VS Code codebase](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/60565). This iteration, we cut the number of remaining strict null errors in half, fixing over 2000 errors. We still have around 1800 strict null errors left, and many of the remaining errors are tricky ones, but the end is in sight.

### Compiling to ES6

VS Code is written TypeScript, and TypeScript is compiled into JavaScript. TypeScript can target different JavaScript versions and with this release, we target ES6 JavaScript. ES6 is much closer to TypeScript and produces less code, which means faster loading times.

**Note:** This means our JavaScript output uses [classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes) as defined in JavaScript. We have a utility in place that still allows functions to "extend" from those classes and we have created a [tracking item](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/68698) for extensions authors to now emit ES6 as well. Everything should still work as before but we encourage everyone to get on the ES6 train.

## Contributions to Extensions

### GitHub Pull Requests

This milestone we continued working on improvements to the [GitHub Pull Requests](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.vscode-pull-request-github) extension.

Below are some of the new features:

* View and assign reviewers and labels on the pull request description page.
* GitHub Pull Request tree views now show in its own view container. You can also choose to show them in Source Control view by modifying `githubPullRequests.showInSCM`.
* View and modify reactions on comments.

### Vetur

[Vetur](https://github.com/vuejs/vetur) extension now provides IntelliSense for Vue.js interpolations.

The completion items are sourced from Vue.js `props`, `data`, `computed` and `methods` API calls. The source code, along with any JSDocs documentation, are used as completion item's description.

When using child components from parent components, Vetur also offers IntelliSense on the child components's `props`.

![Vetur IntelliSense for Vue templates](./images/1_32/vetur-intellisense-vue-template.gif)

Other notable features include:

- Using Prettier as an option for `<template>` formatter.
- GraphQL custom block syntax highligthing.
- Pug interpolation syntax highlighting.

You can learn more about the features in Vetur's [Changelog](https://github.com/vuejs/vetur/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).

## New documentation

### Working with JavaScript

A new [Working with JavaScript](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/working-with-javascript) article describes advanced JavaScript features supported by VS Code. You'll learn the benefits of adding [JavaScript project files](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/working-with-javascript#_javascript-projects-jsconfigjson) (jsconfig.json) to your code as well as how to enable [type checking](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/nodejs/working-with-javascript#_type-checking-javascript).

### Bundling extensions with webpack

For extension authors, there is a new [Bundling Extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/bundling-extension) topic on bundling extensions files with [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to reduce extension load time.

## Notable fixes

* [55084](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/55084): Allow to create/open file names containing backslash
