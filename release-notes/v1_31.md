## Insiders Release

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the January 1.31 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the January release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[January Iteration Plan](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/65570)** - See what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit Log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/83?closed=1)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the January milestone.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the VS Code repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues).

## Workbench

### Configure closing order of tabs

A new setting `workbench.editor.closeTabsInMRUOrder` allows to change the order in which tabs are closed. By default, tabs will close in most-recently-used order. Changing this setting allows to close tabs from right to left instead.

## Languages

### TypeScript 3.3

<!-- TODO mjbvz -->

### Removing the markdown.previewFrontMatter setting

The `markdown.previewFrontMatter` setting has been removed. The Markdown preview now always hides YAML frontmatter (this was the default setting for `markdown.previewFrontMatter`).

Markdown extensions such as [Markdown yaml Preamble](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.markdown-yaml-preamble) and [Github Markdown Preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.github-markdown-preview) render frontmatter as a table in the preview.

## Extension Authoring

### CodeActionKind.intersects

The `CodeActionKind.intersects` method is useful to check if a `CodeActionProvider` should bother computing its Code Actions:

```typescript
import * as vscode from 'vscode';

export class OrganizeImportsProvider implements vscode.CodeActionProvider {
    public provideCodeActions(
        document: vscode.TextDocument,
        range: vscode.Range,
        context: vscode.CodeActionContext,
        token: vscode.CancellationToken
    ): vscode.CodeAction[] {
        // Only return organize imports actions if they were explicitly requested
        // We can check this using `intersects`.
        if (!context.only || !vscode.CodeActionKind.SourceOrganizeImports.intersects(context.only)) {
            // Organize imports organize imports actions were not requested
            return [];
        }

        // Organize imports was requested
        ...
    }
}
```

### Node.js update

The version of Electron that VS Code runs on has been updated which brings with it an update to Node.js that VS Code ships with from `8.9` to `10.2.0`. All extensions will now run on this newer version of Node.js. Take a look at https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v10.0.0/#deprecations for a list of deprecations in node.js 10.

## Proposed Extension APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always we are keen on your feedback. This is what you have to do to try out a proposed API:

* You must use Insiders because proposed APIs change frequently.
* You must have this line in the `package.json` file of your extension: `"enableProposedApi": true`.
* Copy the latest version of the [`vscode.proposed.d.ts`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts) file into your project.

Note that you cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. We may likely make breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### `SignatureHelpContext.activeSignatureHelp`

The proposed `SignatureHelpContext.activeSignatureHelp` field tracks the previously active signature:

```typescript
import * as vscode from 'vscode';

class MySignatureHelpProvider implements vscode.SignatureHelpProvider {
    provideSignatureHelp(
        document: vscode.TextDocument,
        position: vscode.Position,
        token: vscode.CancellationToken,
        context: vscode.SignatureHelpContext
    ): vscode.ProviderResult<vscode.SignatureHelp> {
        // The active signature help when this provider was triggered or undefined if
        // no signature help was active.
        console.log(context.activeSignatureHelp);

        ...
    }
}
```

Providers can use this to track which overload was selected before the signature help provider was re-triggered.

### Auto fix and `CodeAction.isPreferred`

The Code Action API powers VS Code's Quick Fixes (the lightbulbs you see in the editor). Although there may be many Quick Fixes for a given error, often one of these Quick Fixes is the most reasonable fix for the problem. For example, fixing a spelling error is usually the more likely fix than generating new fields:

![The fix spelling quick fix is usually more reasonable than generating properties](images/1_31/api-preferred.png)

By using the proposed API, extensions can set `isPreferred` on a `CodeAction` to indicate that is the most reasonable fix for the underlying problem. Preferred fixes can be automatically applied using the **Auto Fix** command (`kb(editor.action.autoFix)`)

![After applying an auto fix to the error](images/1_31/api-preferred-after.png)

Preferred Quick Fixes should generally:

* Correctly fix the underlying error (and not suppress it).
* Be a reasonable fix for the error.
* Not perform extensive operations unexpectedly.

Refactoring Code Actions can also be marked as preferred to indicate that that they are the most reasonable refactoring. For example, while multiple **Extract constant** refactorings may be available, often the user just wants to extract to the nearest local. If that refactoring Code Action is marked `isPreferred`, users can set up a single keybinding for it:

```json
{
  "key": "ctrl+shift+r ctrl+e",
  "command": "editor.action.codeAction",
  "args": {
    "kind": "refactor.extract.constant",
    "apply": "preferred"
  }
}
```

### Fix-All Source Actions

The proposed `source.fixAll` `CodeActionKind` establishes a convention for extensions that can auto fix errors in a file. This new Source Action kind is similar to **Organize imports** and makes it easy to configure keybindings for fix all actions or enable auto-fix on save:

```json
// On save, run both fixAll and organizeImports source actions
"editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    "source.fixAll": true,
    "source.organizeImports": true,
}
```

The [TS Lint extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-tslint-plugin) already uses this proposed source Code Action kind to implement fix all and auto fix on save.

## Engineering

### Electron 3.0 Update and Electron 4.0 Exploration

In this milestone we finished the exploration of bundling Electron 3 into VS Code making it the first time we ship this Electron version to stable. This is a major Electron release and comes with Chrome 66 and Node.js 10.x (a major leap forward compared to our current version that has Chrome 61 and Node.js 8.x).

At the same time we started to explore updating to Electron 4 which we envision to push to insiders soon.

## Notable Changes

* [7570](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/7570): VSCode does not open offline
* [34396](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/34396): High CPU on single CPU VM
