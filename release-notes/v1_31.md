## Insiders Release

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the January 1.31 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the January release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[January Iteration Plan](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/65570)** - See what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit Log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/83?closed=1)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the January milestone.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the VS Code repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues).

## Languages

### TypeScript 3.3

<!-- TODO mjbvz -->

### Removing the markdown.previewFrontMatter setting

The `markdown.previewFrontMatter` setting has been removed. The markdown preview now always hides yaml frontmatter (this was the default setting for `markdown.previewFrontMatter`).

Markdown extensions such as [Markdown yaml Preamble](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.markdown-yaml-preamble) or the [Github markdown preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.github-markdown-preview) render frontmatter as a table in the preview.

## Extension Authoring

### CodeActionKind.intersects

The `CodeActionKind.intersects` method helps check if:

```typescript
import * as vscode from 'vscode';

export class OrganizeImportsProvider implements vscode.CodeActionProvider {
    public provideCodeActions(
        document: vscode.TextDocument,
        range: vscode.Range,
        context: vscode.CodeActionContext,
        token: vscode.CancellationToken
    ): vscode.CodeAction[] {
        if (!context.only || !vscode.CodeActionKind.SourceOrganizeImports.intersects(context.only)) {
            // Organize imports organize imports actions were not requested
            return [];
        }
        //
        ...
    }
}
```

## Proposed Extension APIs

### `SignatureHelpContext.activeSignatureHelp`

The proposed `SignatureHelpContext.activeSignatureHelp` field tracks the previously active signature:

```typescript
import * as vscode from 'vscode';

class MySignatureHelpProvider implements vscode.SignatureHelpProvider {
    provideSignatureHelp(
        document: vscode.TextDocument,
        position: vscode.Position,
        token: vscode.CancellationToken,
        context: vscode.SignatureHelpContext
    ): vscode.ProviderResult<vscode.SignatureHelp> {
        // The active signature help when this provider was triggered or undefined if
        // no signature help was active.
        console.log(context.activeSignatureHelp);

        ...
    }
}
```

Providers can use this to track the overload was selected before the signature help provider was re-triggered.

### Auto fix and `CodeAction.isPreferred`

The code action API powers VS Code's quick fixes (the lightbulbs you see in the editor). Although there may be many quick fixes for a given error, often one of these quick fixes is the most reasonable fix for the problem. For example, fixing a spelling error is usually the more likely fix than generating new fields:

![The fix spelling quick fix is usually more reasonable than generating properties](images/1_31/api-preferred.png)

Using proposed api, extensions can set `isPreferred` on a `CodeAction` to indicate that is the most reasonable fix for the underlying problem. Preferred fixes can be automatically applied using the `Auto Fix` command (`kb(editor.action.autoFix)`)

![After applying an auto fix to the error](images/1_31/api-preferred-after.png)

Preferred quick fixes  should generally:

- Correctly fix the underlying error (and not suppress it).
- Be a reasonable fix for the error.
- Not perform extensive operations unexpectedly.

Refactoring code actions can also be marked as preferred to indicate that that they are the most reasonable refactoring. For example, while multiple `extract constant` refactorings may be available, often the user just wants to extract to the nearest local. If that refactoring code action is marked  `isPreferred`, users can setup a single keybinding for it:

```json
{
  "key": "ctrl+shift+r ctrl+e",
  "command": "editor.action.codeAction",
  "args": {
    "kind": "refactor.extract.constant",
    "apply": "preferred"
  }
}
```
