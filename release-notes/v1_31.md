## Insiders release

Welcome to the Insiders build. These are the preliminary notes for the January 1.31 release of Visual Studio Code. As we get closer to the release date, you'll see details below about new features and important fixes.

Until the January release notes are available, you can still track our progress:

* **[January Iteration Plan](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/65570)** - See what's planned for the milestone.
* **[Commit Log](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/commits/master)** - GitHub commits to the vscode open-source repository.
* **[Closed issues](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/milestone/83?closed=1)** - Resolved bugs and implemented feature requests in the January milestone.

We really appreciate people taking a look at our new features as soon as they are ready so check back here often and learn what's new to try out.

If you find issues or have suggestions, you can enter them in the VS Code repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues).

## Workbench

### Closing order of editor tabs

A new setting `workbench.editor.focusRecentEditorAfterClose` allows you to change the order in which editor tabs are closed. By default, tabs will close in most recently used (MRU) order. Changing this setting allows closing tabs from right to left instead.

### Updated Go menu

We added more entries to the **Go** menu and put separators to group actions logically:

![Go Menu](images/1_31/go-menu.png)

### New title variables

There are three new variables that can be used within the `window.title` setting:

* `${activeFolderShort}`: The name of the folder the file is contained in.
* `${activeFolderMedium}`: The path of the folder the file is contained in, relative to the workspace folder.
* `${activeFolderLong}`: The full path of the folder the file is contained in.

### Problems panel

**Multi-line messages**

The Problems panel now shows multi-line messages in separate lines.

![Problems panel multi-line messages](images/1_31/problems-multi-line.gif)

You can also toggle to show or hide the complete message.

**Trigger Code actions using keyboard shortcut**

You can now trigger code actions from Problems panel using the same default keyboard shortcut `kb(editor.action.quickFix)` as Quick fix command.

## Editor

### Smart Selections

We have worked on the implementation of "Grow Selection" and "Shrink Selection". For once, we are in the process of adding API so that language servers can tell us what to select but the default implementation got smarter too.

![](images/1_31/smart-select-demo.gif)

Stay tuned - there is more to come as smart select is overhauled. Use the [`smart-select`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Asmart-select)-label to see what we are working on.

### Snippets

When authoring snippets with long descriptions you would be forced to write a long single string. No support for using and array as you can do it for `body`. This has no changed and long descriptions can be written using string arrays.

```json
{
  "prefix": "happy",
    "body": "#Happy Coding!",
    "description": [
      "First Line",
      "Second Line",
      "Third Line"
    ]
}
```

### References History

There is now a "Show History"-command for the references viewlet. It brings up quick pick with previous search allowing speedy re-runs of previous searches.

![Reference Search History](images/1_31/ref-history.png)


### Reference Code Lens

When selecting a reference code lens then a peek editor opens. This can now be controled with the `references.preferredLocation`-setting. Its options are `peek` and `view` - the latter shows references in the new viewlet.

## Languages

### TypeScript 3.3

<!-- TODO mjbvz -->

### Removing the markdown.previewFrontMatter setting

The `markdown.previewFrontMatter` setting has been removed. The Markdown preview now always hides YAML frontmatter (this was the default setting for `markdown.previewFrontMatter`).

Markdown extensions such as [Markdown yaml Preamble](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.markdown-yaml-preamble) and [GitHub Markdown Preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.github-markdown-preview) render frontmatter as a table in the preview.

## Debug and tasks

### Command-based user input variable

The [input variables](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_30#_improved-user-input-variables-for-task-and-debug-configurations) introduced last milestone are a powerful mechanism to ask for user input in tasks or debug configurations. Initially, we made `promptString` and `pickString` input variables available.

In this milestone, we are introducing a new type of input variable `command` which runs an arbitrary command when an input variable is interpolated. Since commands can be contributed by extensions, it is now possible to extend user input variables by new implementations.

The following example shows how to use a user input variable of type `command` in a debug configuration that lets the user pick a test case from a list of all test cases found in a specific folder. It is assumed that some extension provides an `extension.mochaSupport.testPicker` command that locates all test cases in a configurable location and shows a picker UI to pick one of them.

```json
{
   "configurations": [
      {
         "type": "node",
         "request": "launch",
         "name": "Launch Test",
         "program": "${workspaceFolder}/${input:pickTest}"
      }
   ],
   "inputs": [
      {
         "id": "pickTest",
         "type": "command",
         "command": "extension.mochaSupport.testPicker",
         "args": {
            "testFolder": "${workspaceFolder}/tests",
         }
      }
   ]
}
```

## Preview features

Preview features are not ready for release but are functional enough to use. We welcome your early feedback while they are under development.

### HTML and CSS custom data support

ðŸš§ This feature is in preview and the settings, Contribution Points, and data formats are subject to change. ðŸš§

Today, front-end developers often code in a superset of HTML/CSS:

* WebComponent allows custom HTML elements such as `<my-button type="alert"></my-button>`.
* PostCSS allows custom CSS properties such as [`size`](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-size) and not-yet-standardized CSS features such as [`:any-link`](https://preset-env.cssdb.org/features#any-link-pseudo-class).
* Various frameworks allow even greater flexibility in the source HTML/CSS.

In this iteration, we improved the [HTML custom data support](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_30#_html-custom-tags-attributes-support) introduced in 1.30 and added CSS custom data support.

* Use `html.experimental.customData` or `css.experimental.customData` to load custom data. (`html.experimental.custom.tags` and `html.experimental.custom.attributes` are removed.)
* Alternatively, bundle the JSON into an extension with `contributes.html.experimental.customData` or `contributes.css.experimental.customData`.
* Finally, if you are writing a Language Server that uses [vscode-html-languageservice](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-html-languageservice) or [vscode-css-languageservice](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-css-languageservice), you can create the Language Service with custom data.

Custom data enhances VS Code's understanding of HTML/CSS. For example, with these HTML/CSS JSON contributions, VS Code could provide completion and hover for the custom HTML tag/attribute and CSS property/pseudoClass:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "tags": [{
      "name": "my-button",
      "description": "My button",
      "attributes": [{
        "name": "type",
        "description": "My button type",
        "values": [
          { "name": "alert" }
        ]
      }]
  }]
}
```

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "properties": [{
    "name": "my-size",
    "description": "Compiles down to `width` and `height`. See details at https://github.com/postcss/postcss-size."
  }],
  "pseudoClasses": [{
    "name": ":my-link",
    "description": ":any-link pseudo class. See details at https://preset-env.cssdb.org/features#any-link-pseudo-class."
  }]
}
```

![custom data](images/1_31/customdata.gif)

The above sample is available at [octref/simple-customdata](https://github.com/octref/simple-customdata), while a more fully-featured sample is available at [octref/svg-data](https://github.com/octref/svg-data).

These guides explain the data format and how to use them through settings and extension Contribution Points.

* [Guide](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-html-languageservice/blob/master/docs/customData.md) for using HTML Custom Data
* [Guide](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-css-languageservice/blob/master/docs/customData.md) for using CSS Custom Data

## Extension authoring

### Open Resources

A new function to open things has been added: `vscode.env.openExternal`. It expects a url and can be used to open website-links, mail-links, or application-url-handler. Also, file-urls are accepted which allows to open them in their default app, like a pdf-file.

```ts
// open defaut browser
await vscode.env.openExternal(vscode.Uri.parse("https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/66741"));
```

### CodeActionKind.intersects

The `CodeActionKind.intersects` method is useful to check if a `CodeActionProvider` should bother computing its Code Actions:

```typescript
import * as vscode from 'vscode';

export class OrganizeImportsProvider implements vscode.CodeActionProvider {
    public provideCodeActions(
        document: vscode.TextDocument,
        range: vscode.Range,
        context: vscode.CodeActionContext,
        token: vscode.CancellationToken
    ): vscode.CodeAction[] {
        // Only return organize imports actions if they were explicitly requested
        // We can check this using `intersects`.
        if (!context.only || !vscode.CodeActionKind.SourceOrganizeImports.intersects(context.only)) {
            // Organize imports organize imports actions were not requested
            return [];
        }

        // Organize imports was requested
        ...
    }
}
```

### Node.js update

The version of Electron that VS Code runs on has been updated which brings with it an update to Node.js from `8.9` to `10.2.0`. All extensions will now run on this newer version of Node.js. Take a look at [Node v10.0.0 deprecations](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v10.0.0/#deprecations) for a list of deprecations in Node.js 10.

### Add Arguments to Keybindings

When defining keybinding in `package.json` you can now define arguments. Upon execution those arguments are passed on to the command - in the sample below it is: `{foo: 1, bar: 2}`.

```json
"keybindings": {
  "key": "cmd+i",
  "command": "myCommand",
  "args": {
    "foo": 1,
    "bar": 2
  }
}
```

## Proposed extension APIs

Every milestone comes with new proposed APIs and extension authors can try them out. As always we are keen on your feedback. This is what you have to do to try out a proposed API:

* You must use Insiders because proposed APIs change frequently.
* You must have this line in the `package.json` file of your extension: `"enableProposedApi": true`.
* Copy the latest version of the [`vscode.proposed.d.ts`](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/blob/master/src/vs/vscode.proposed.d.ts) file into your project.

Note that you cannot publish an extension that uses a proposed API. We may likely make breaking changes in the next release and we never want to break existing extensions.

### `SignatureHelpContext.activeSignatureHelp`

The proposed `SignatureHelpContext.activeSignatureHelp` field tracks the previously active signature:

```typescript
import * as vscode from 'vscode';

class MySignatureHelpProvider implements vscode.SignatureHelpProvider {
    provideSignatureHelp(
        document: vscode.TextDocument,
        position: vscode.Position,
        token: vscode.CancellationToken,
        context: vscode.SignatureHelpContext
    ): vscode.ProviderResult<vscode.SignatureHelp> {
        // The active signature help when this provider was triggered or undefined if
        // no signature help was active.
        console.log(context.activeSignatureHelp);

        ...
    }
}
```

Providers can use this to track which overload was selected before the signature help provider was retriggered.

### Auto fix and `CodeAction.isPreferred`

The Code Action API powers VS Code's Quick Fixes (the lightbulbs you see in the editor). Although there may be many Quick Fixes for a given error, often one of these Quick Fixes is the most reasonable fix for the problem. For example, fixing a spelling error is usually the more likely fix than generating new fields:

![The fix spelling quick fix is usually more reasonable than generating properties](images/1_31/api-preferred.png)

By using the proposed API, extensions can set `isPreferred` on a `CodeAction` to indicate that is the most reasonable fix for the underlying problem. Preferred fixes can be automatically applied using the **Auto Fix** command (`kb(editor.action.autoFix)`)

![After applying an auto fix to the error](images/1_31/api-preferred-after.png)

Preferred Quick Fixes should generally:

* Correctly fix the underlying error (and not suppress it).
* Be a reasonable fix for the error.
* Not perform extensive operations unexpectedly.

Refactoring Code Actions can also be marked as preferred to indicate that they are the most reasonable refactoring. For example, while multiple **Extract constant** refactorings may be available, often the user just wants to extract to the nearest local. If that refactoring Code Action is marked `isPreferred`, users can set up a single keybinding for it:

```json
{
  "key": "ctrl+shift+r ctrl+e",
  "command": "editor.action.codeAction",
  "args": {
    "kind": "refactor.extract.constant",
    "apply": "preferred"
  }
}
```

### Fix All Source Actions

The proposed `source.fixAll` `CodeActionKind` establishes a convention for extensions that can auto fix errors in a file. This new Source Action kind is similar to **Organize imports** and makes it easy to configure keybindings for fix all actions or enable autofix on save:

```json
// On save, run both fixAll and organizeImports source actions
"editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
    "source.fixAll": true,
    "source.organizeImports": true,
}
```

The [TS Lint extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-typescript-tslint-plugin) already uses this proposed source Code Action kind to implement fix all and auto fix on save.

### Debug Adapter Protocol

**Proposed Debug Adapter Protocol for data breakpoints**

As a follow-up step for the [ongoing work on data breakpoints](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/58304) (AKA "watchpoints"), we made some progress on the design of the Debug Adapter Protocol for data breakpoints. The proposed DAP changes live on this [branch](https://github.com/Microsoft/debug-adapter-protocol/tree/aweinand/data-breakpoints) and the corresponding TypeScript API can be found [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/debug-adapter-protocol/issues/20#issue-384366398).

If you are interested in supporting data breakpoints in your debugger extension, please have a look at the [proposal](https://github.com/Microsoft/debug-adapter-protocol/issues/20) and provide feedback.

## Engineering

### Electron 3.0 update and Electron 4.0 exploration

In this milestone, we finished the exploration of bundling Electron 3 into VS Code, making it the first time we ship this Electron version to stable. This is a major Electron release and comes with Chrome 66 and Node.js 10.x (a major leap forward compared to our current version that has Chrome 61 and Node.js 8.x).

At the same time, we started to explore updating to Electron 4, which we hope to push to Insiders soon.

### Better Performance Information

With this relase the "F1 > Developer: Startup Performance" information is presented in the editor, not in dev tools anymore. That makes it easier to read and faster to get to. Also, along the way many issues have been fixed.

## New documentation

### Updated Extension API documentation

For extension authors, the VS Code [API](https://code.visualstudio.com/api) documentation was rewritten and moved to its own table of contents.

![API TOC on code.visualstudio.com](images/1_31/API-TOC.png)

Here you'll find articles to:

* Get you started with your [first extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/get-started/your-first-extension).
* Learn about various extension [capabilities](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-capabilities/overview).
* Find extension [guides](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/overview) and [advanced topics](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/advanced-topics/extension-host).
* Complete API [references](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/references/vscode-api).

### Python Jupyter Notebooks

A new [Working with Jupyter Notebooks](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/jupyter-support) topic describes how to open, debug, and export [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) from within VS Code.

## Notable fixes
